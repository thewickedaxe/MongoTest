This is a work in progress of our blood donation app which we built for a hackathon. Currently I've managed to get a Mongo instance up and working and have implemented basic user data capture functionality. 

What still needs to done from an app standpoint is 

1) get GCM back. The old app was too hastily done and is virtually unsalvageable
2) implement shared preferences to stop users from having to log in everytime
